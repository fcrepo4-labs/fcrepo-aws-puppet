This Puppet script starts an AWS EC2 instance, then deploys fcrepo-kitchen-sink to a stand-alone Tomcat7 application server.

Note, this script has only been tested on Ubuntu 12.10.

To run this script:
1. Install the following packages
sudo apt-get install cloud-utils puppet-common git -y

2. Put your AWS credentials in the file: ~/.awssecret, in the form:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECRET_KEY

3. Clone this project
git clone ...

4. Update the EC2 configuration elements found in ./fcrepo-aws-puppet/cloud-init/create-ec2-instance.conf

5. Run
cd fcrepo-aws-puppet
./cloud-init/create-ec2-instance.sh

Note: There is a script in the root directory which can be run to try out the puppet script locally without starting an EC2 instance:
sudo ./test.sh --noop
